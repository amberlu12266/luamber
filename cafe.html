						<p>This mobile application is designed based on problems observed in Taiwan, where COVID-19 situations were not as severe and regulations were looser.</p>
						<br>
						<h5 style="color:#D47430">PROBLEM</h5>
						<p>Since the pandamic, a lot of international students flies home and continue to attend university online. The demand to search for cafes suitable for studying anda working has increased. However, there lacks a user-centric app that helps these cafe goers explore cafes easier.</p>
						<br>
						<h5 style="color:#D47430">OUTCOME</h5>
						<p>To address this problem, I created a Mocha: mobile app that helps cafe goers <span style="background-color: #FFE9DA">efficiently search and discover cafes</span> that are suitable for their needs</p>

						<p>Users need to know if there are power outlets, speed of wifi, if pets are allowed, are there time limits? All of these factors determine if a cafe fits the users’ demands. <span style="background-color: #FFE9DA">Incomplete information raises difficulty and prolongs user's decision making process.</span><br>Almost 90% of users look for cafes through Google maps. However Google maps would incorporate restaurants into the results, making it hard for users to extract information.</p>

						<p>Since the goal at the current stage is to create a minimum viable product, I came up with a list of features and functionalities that are either present in other similar application or requested/mentioned by interview participants.

						<h4>User testing and iterations</h4>
					</div>
					<div class="col-9">
						<p>After creating clickthrough wireframes, I conducted user testing to validate the design and product direction. Based off the findings, I made some iterations to the user flow and screens.</p>

				<div class="row">

						<img src="img/work/caferoam/decision_home.png" class="img-center" style="width:100%">
						<br>
						<p>At first, the approach was to allow users to quickly see different categories of cafes. I later realized that this complicates the process. Based on the observation of user behaviors, <span style="background-color: #FFE9DA">Location > Amenities but searching by amenities should be easily accessible as well.</span> So I iterated the design to show cafes nearby with visible tags on top. I originally want the search field to be at the center of the screen for easier access but considering the fact that users are more likely to look at nearby cafes than search for a cafe, I moved it to the top.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="col-9">
						<img src="img/work/caferoam/decision_search.png" class="img-center" style="width:100%">
						<br>
						<p>For the initial design, the "amenities" are organized in categories as a collection of cafes recommended to the users. And then users could apply filters to narrow down the search results. As the second iteration, I decided to get rid of categories and just allow users to search immediately through tags/filters instead. Eventually, as the tags/filters were moved to the home page, I got rid of them in the searching process and displayed previous searches instead.</p>

						<h4>Reflection + What's Next?</h4>
					</div>
					<div class="col-9">
						<h5 style="color:#D47430"><b>1. Get rid of unnecessary elements</b></h5>
						<p>When I was designing the navigation, I realized that having a navigation bar at the bottom isn't necessary since the purpose of this product is for users to search and explore with ease. It's easy to fall into the pattern of thinking some elements are necessary but when you take a step back and think about what users really want, a lot of elements can be eliminated.</p>
						<br>
						<h5 style="color:#D47430"><b>2. Be comfortable with uncertainty and changes</b></h5>
						<p>The process of design isn't a straight line. Sometimes, even after conducting proper and complete research and analysis, more discoveries might appear later on in the stage of design. Hence why I had to make changes to the user flow, something that's completed in the early stages of defining the product. I think it's important to realize that changes are a normal part of design.</p>
						<br>
						<p>I really enjoyed designing this product and I would consider adding more features and actually building this product and pushing it to the app store in the future.</p>
